# Auth0 + iOS + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an app that will use Auth0, iOS with Objective C and an API that you're going to be developing. That API can be in any language.

## Running the example

In order to run the project, you need to have `XCode` installed.
Once you have that, just clone the project and run the following:

1. `pod install`
2. `open basic-sample.xcworkspace`

Enjoy your iOS app now :).
